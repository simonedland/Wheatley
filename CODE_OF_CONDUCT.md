# Wheatley Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. To keep testing safe and pleasant for all participants, we enforce the following rules:

- Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or discriminatory language will be incinerated faster than a rogue turret.
- Keep discussions focused on improving Wheatley. Off-topic rants belong in the incinerator.
- Report unacceptable behavior to the code owners immediately. We take violations seriously, and GLaDOS does not tolerate nonsense.

Violations may result in removal from the project with no second chances. The cake is a lie, but these rules are not.
