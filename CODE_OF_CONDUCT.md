# Wheatley Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. To keep testing safe and pleasant for all participants, we enforce the following rules:

- Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or discriminatory language will be incinerated faster than a rogue turret.
- Keep discussions focused on improving Wheatley. Off-topic rants belong in the incinerator.
- Report unacceptable behavior to contact@example.com.

Violations may result in removal from the project with no second chances. The cake is a lie, but these rules are not.
