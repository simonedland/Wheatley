## Getting Started

1. Create your configuration:
   - Copy the example file from:
    `\wheatley\config\config.example.yaml`
     to
    `\wheatley\config\config.yaml`
   - Edit `config.yaml` to adjust settings as needed.
2. Run the system check script:
   > .\system check.ps1  
   This script:
   - Verifies Python is installed.
   - Creates and activates the virtual environment (.venv) if needed.
   - Installs all prerequisites.
   - Checks for the configuration file.
   - Runs initial tests.
3. Initialize the environment:
   - Once the configuration file is set and prerequisites installed, the environment is ready.
   - To manually activate the environment, run:
    > .\\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   - To deactivate the environment when needed, simply type:
     > deactivate
   - To reinitialize, delete the `.venv` folder and re-run the system check script.
   - Confirm that the virtual environment activates without errors and tests execute successfully.

4. Run the assistant from the project root:
   > python -m wheatley

## Roadmap
### TTS
- [ ] end to end streaming
  - [ ] STT streaming input transcription
  [reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text?lang=curl#streaming-transcriptions)
  - [ ] Stream LLM response to TTS
  TTS does not support streaming innput there is therefore no value in streaming the LLM response to TTS.
