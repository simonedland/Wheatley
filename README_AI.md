# AI Codebase Overview

Certainly! Here is a detailed summary and analysis of the provided Python script, **ad_nauseam.py**:

---

## Overall Purpose

The script **ad_nauseam.py** is designed to automate the process of generating AI-powered summaries and visualizations for source code files (specifically Python `.py` and Arduino `.ino` files) within a directory tree. Its main objectives are to:

- **Summarize each source file** in plain English using an LLM (Large Language Model, via OpenAI API).
- **Aggregate summaries** at the directory and project (root) level.
- **Generate visualizations** (using Mermaid diagrams) to illustrate code structure and relationships.
- **Write documentation files** (`README_AI.md` and `AI_Graph.md`) in each relevant folder and at the project root.

This tool is intended to help developers quickly understand, document, and visualize large or unfamiliar codebases with minimal manual effort.

## Main Classes and Functions

### 1. **Configuration Helpers**
- **_load_config()**: Loads a YAML configuration file (typically `config.yaml`) that contains secrets such as the OpenAI API key and other runtime settings.
- **Config (dataclass)**: Encapsulates runtime configuration, such as the LLM model name, temperature, and file types to process. It allows for environment variable overrides.

### 2. **LLMClient**
- **Purpose**: Handles all interactions with the OpenAI API.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Loads the API key and model configuration.
  - Constructs prompts tailored to the file type (Python or Arduino).
  - Sends file contents to the LLM and retrieves summaries or diagram code.
  - Handles dry-run mode (for testing without making API calls).
  - Robustly extracts summary text from various OpenAI API response formats.

### 3. **DirectoryCrawler**
- **Purpose**: Recursively scans a target directory for `.py` and `.ino` files, excluding any paths that contain `.venv` (to avoid virtual environments).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Returns a list of all relevant source files for processing.

### 4. **Summariser**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire summarization and visualization workflow.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Crawls the directory for source files.
  - Summarizes each file using the LLMClient.
  - Aggregates summaries by directory.
  - Writes `README_AI.md` files in each folder and at the root, containing human-readable summaries.
  - Generates Mermaid diagrams for each directory and the entire project, outputting them as `AI_Graph.md`.
  - Handles dry-run and verbose modes for testing and debugging.

### 5. **CLI Entry Point**
- **_parse_args()**: Parses command-line arguments (such as target path and dry-run flag).
- **main()**: Sets up the Summariser and runs the workflow based on parsed arguments.
- **if __name__ == "__main__"**: Standard Python entry point for running the script as a standalone tool.

## Structure and Component Interaction

1. **Startup**: The script is run from the command line, with optional arguments for the target directory and dry-run mode.
2. **Configuration**: Loads the YAML config to retrieve the OpenAI API key and other settings.
3. **File Crawling**: Recursively finds all relevant source files, skipping virtual environment directories.
4. **Summarization**:
   - For each file, reads its content and sends it to the LLM with a file-type-specific prompt.
   - Collects the resulting summaries, grouping them by directory.
5. **Output Generation**:
   - Writes `README_AI.md` files in each directory and at the root, containing summaries of the files and, at the root, an overview of the entire codebase.
   - Generates Mermaid diagrams for each directory and the project as a whole, outputting them as `AI_Graph.md`.
6. **Visualization**: Mermaid diagrams visually represent file relationships and code structure.

## External Dependencies, APIs, and Configuration

- **openai**: Official OpenAI Python client for LLM-powered summarization and diagram generation.
- **yaml**: For reading configuration files.
- **tqdm**: For progress bars during file processing.
- **argparse**: For command-line argument parsing.
- **dataclasses, pathlib, typing**: Standard Python modules for data handling and type hints.

**Configuration Requirement**:
- A YAML config file (e.g., `config/config.yaml`) containing at least:
  ```yaml
  secrets:
    openai_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  ```
- The OpenAI model can be overridden via the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable.

## Notable Algorithms and Logic

- **File Filtering**: Uses recursive globbing and path filtering to efficiently locate all relevant source files, while excluding virtual environments.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamically generates detailed prompts for the LLM, tailored to the file type, to ensure high-quality, context-aware summaries and diagrams.
- **Response Extraction**: Handles multiple possible OpenAI API response formats for robustness.
- **Mermaid Diagram Generation**: Sends file contents to the LLM with explicit instructions to output Mermaid code blocks, visualizing code structure and relationships.
- **Aggregation**: Groups summaries by directory for folder-level and root-level overviews.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Allows users to test the workflow without making actual API calls, which is useful for debugging or development.
