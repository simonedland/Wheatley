### C:\GIT\eatly\Wheatley\Weatly\python\src\hardware\arduino_interface.py
The Python code defines an interface for communicating with Arduino hardware, focusing on controlling servos to perform animations based on emotions. It includes classes for managing the connection and communication with an Arduino device, as well as controlling servos.

1. **ArduinoInterface Class**: 
   - Manages the connection to an Arduino via a specified port and baud rate.
   - Supports a "dry run" mode for testing without actual hardware.
   - Can send commands to the Arduino and read responses.
   - Integrates a `ServoController` to manage servo animations based on emotions.

2. **Servo Class**:
   - Represents an individual servo motor with properties like ID, angle, velocity, and range.
   - Can move to a specified target angle within its allowed range.

3. **ServoController Class**:
   - Manages multiple servos, each configured with specific parameters like name, angle range, and animation interval.
   - Defines animations for different emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad) using parameters like velocities, target factors, and idle ranges.
   - Adjusts servos to reflect the desired emotional animation.

The code facilitates setting up and controlling servo-based animations on Arduino hardware, allowing for expressive movements based on predefined emotional states.
