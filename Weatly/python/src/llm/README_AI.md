### C:\GIT\eatly\Wheatley\Weatly\python\src\llm\google_agent.py
The Python code defines a system for managing Google Calendar events using a class structure. It includes two main classes, `GoogleCalendarManager` and `GoogleAgent`.

1. **GoogleCalendarManager**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages interactions with Google Calendar.
   - **Initialization**: Loads configuration from a YAML file and sets up Google API credentials.
   - **Methods**:
     - `get_google_credentials`: Retrieves and refreshes Google API credentials.
     - `list_calendars`: Lists available calendars, excluding those specified in the configuration.
     - `get_upcoming_events`: Fetches upcoming events from calendars for a specified number of days.
     - `print_calendars` and `print_upcoming_events`: Print calendar details and upcoming events.

2. **GoogleAgent**:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as an intermediary, using an LLM (Language Model) to decide which calendar-related action to perform based on user input.
   - **Initialization**: Loads configuration, including OpenAI API key, and initializes the `GoogleCalendarManager`.
   - **Methods**:
     - `llm_decide_and_dispatch`: Uses an LLM to choose the appropriate action based on user requests, then executes it.
     - `dispatch`: Executes the chosen function, such as fetching calendar events.
     - `get_google_calendar_events`: Retrieves upcoming events by delegating to `GoogleCalendarManager`.

The code also includes placeholder functions for creating and deleting calendar events, though these are not implemented. The system uses OpenAI's API to assist in decision-making regarding which calendar function to invoke.

### C:\GIT\eatly\Wheatley\Weatly\python\src\llm\llm_client.py
This Python code is designed to interact with various APIs and perform tasks such as text-to-speech conversion, weather retrieval, and Google Calendar management. Here's a breakdown of its main components and logic:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The code loads configuration settings from a YAML file, which includes API keys and other parameters.

2. **Weather Descriptions**: It defines a dictionary mapping weather codes to descriptions, which is used to interpret weather data.

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Class**: 
   - Initializes with settings from the configuration file.
   - Uses the ElevenLabs API to convert text to speech.
   - Plays the generated audio using the `playsound` library.

4. **GPT Client**:
   - Interacts with the OpenAI API to generate text responses.
   - Supports functions like generating text, replying with animations, and executing workflows with various tools.

5. **Functions Class**:
   - Executes workflows by calling different functions based on the input.
   - Functions include getting weather data, jokes, quotes, reversing text, getting city coordinates, and advice.
   - Uses external APIs like Open-Meteo for weather and API Ninjas for quotes and advice.

6. **Google Calendar Management**:
   - Attempts to import and use a `GoogleCalendarManager` class to manage Google Calendar events, such as printing calendars and upcoming events.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**: 
   - Implements error handling for API requests and file operations.
   - Uses logging to capture warnings and errors.

Overall, the code integrates multiple APIs to provide a range of functionalities, including TTS, weather information, and calendar management, while ensuring configurability and error handling.
