# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatley\ino\OpenRB150\default.ino
Certainly! Here’s a detailed summary of the provided Arduino sketch in plain English:

---

## **Overall Purpose**

This Arduino sketch acts as a **bidirectional serial bridge** between a computer (via the USB serial port) and a DYNAMIXEL bus (via a hardware serial port, typically Serial1). It allows data to be transparently passed back and forth between the two interfaces, making the Arduino function as a USB-to-DYNAMIXEL adapter. This is useful for configuring, testing, or controlling DYNAMIXEL servos using a PC.

---

## **Main Functions and Responsibilities**

### 1. **Serial Communication Bridging**
- **USB ↔ DYNAMIXEL Bus:**  
  The sketch reads data from the USB serial port and writes it to the DYNAMIXEL bus, and vice versa. This allows commands and responses to flow between a computer and DYNAMIXEL devices.

### 2. **LED Status Indication**
- The built-in LED is used to indicate data transfer activity.

### 3. **Baudrate Synchronization**
- The sketch ensures that the baudrate of the DYNAMIXEL bus matches the baudrate of the USB serial port, updating it if necessary.

---

## **Hardware Peripherals Used**

- **Serial Ports:**
  - `Serial` (USB): Communication with a PC.
  - `Serial1` (DXL_BUS): Communication with DYNAMIXEL devices.
- **Built-in LED:** Used as a simple activity indicator.

---

## **Key Classes, Functions, and Their Responsibilities**

### **Classes**

- **Dynamixel2Arduino**
  - Provided by the [Dynamixel2Arduino library](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/arduino_api/overview/).
  - Manages communication with DYNAMIXEL devices.
  - Used here mainly to configure the serial port for DYNAMIXEL communication.

### **Functions**

- **`setup()`**
  - Initializes the built-in LED pin.
  - Starts the USB serial port at 57600 baud.
  - Initializes the DYNAMIXEL bus serial port to match the USB baudrate.
  - Sets up the DYNAMIXEL2Arduino object.

- **`loop()`**
  - Continuously calls `dataTransceiver()` to handle data transfer.
  - Checks if the USB baudrate has changed and updates the DYNAMIXEL bus baudrate accordingly.

- **`dataTransceiver()`**
  - Handles the actual data transfer in both directions:
    - **USB → DXL:** Reads available bytes from USB and writes them to the DYNAMIXEL bus.
    - **DXL → USB:** Reads available bytes from the DYNAMIXEL bus and writes them to USB.
  - Uses a buffer (`packet_buffer`) to temporarily store incoming DXL data.
  - Calls `ledStatus()` to indicate activity.

- **`ledStatus()`**
  - Turns the built-in LED on for 200 ms after data transfer, then turns it off.
  - Uses `millis()` for non-blocking timing.

---

## **Code Structure and Component Interaction**

1. **Initialization (`setup`)**
   - Set up hardware (LED, serial ports).
   - Prepare the DYNAMIXEL2Arduino object for communication.

2. **Main Loop (`loop`)**
   - Repeatedly calls `dataTransceiver()` to check for and relay data.
   - Monitors for baudrate changes and updates the DYNAMIXEL bus if needed.

3. **Data Transfer (`dataTransceiver`)**
   - Forwards data from USB to DXL and vice versa.
   - Uses a buffer to handle DXL-to-USB transfers.
   - Calls `ledStatus()` to flash the LED on data activity.

4. **LED Activity (`ledStatus`)**
   - Manages the timing and state of the built-in LED to indicate recent data transfer.

---

## **Notable Algorithms or Logic**

- **Bidirectional Serial Bridging:**  
  The core logic is a simple, efficient loop that checks for available data on each serial port and forwards it to the other port. This is a common pattern for serial bridges.

- **Non-blocking LED Timing:**  
  Uses `millis()` to manage LED timing without blocking code execution.

- **Baudrate Synchronization:**  
  Automatically updates the DYNAMIXEL bus baudrate if the USB baudrate changes.

---

## **External Libraries and Dependencies**

- **Dynamixel2Arduino**  
  - Required for DYNAMIXEL bus communication.
  - Must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager or manually.

---

## **Configuration and Environment Requirements**

- **Hardware:**
  - An Arduino board with at least two serial ports (e.g., Arduino Mega, Leonardo, or boards with a DYNAMIXEL Shield).
  - DYNAMIXEL servos connected to the appropriate serial port (Serial1).
  - USB connection to a PC.

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE.
  - Dynamixel2Arduino library installed.

- **Baudrate:**
  - Default baudrate is 57600 for both USB and DYNAMIXEL bus, but the sketch will adapt if the USB baudrate changes.

---

## **Overall Purpose**

This sketch is designed for an **OpenRB-150 board** (Arduino-compatible, likely with SAMD architecture), acting as a **UART bridge** between the board and a "Core-2" device (probably an ESP32-based controller). It also demonstrates **multi-servo calibration** using Dynamixel servos, allowing the Core-2 to command servo movements and receive calibration data.

### **Key Features**
- **UART Bridge**: Communicates with Core-2 via Serial3 (pins D14/D13).
- **Servo Calibration**: Calibrates up to 7 Dynamixel servos, auto-detecting or using manual limits.
- **Command Handling**: Receives and executes servo move commands from Core-2.
- **Status Reporting**: Sends servo calibration and status back to Core-2.
- **Demo Mode**: Sweeps a servo for demonstration purposes.

---

## **Hardware Peripherals Used**

- **Serial Ports**:
  - `Serial` (USB): Debug output.
  - `Serial1`: For Dynamixel bus (servos).
  - `Serial3` (aliased as `Serial2`): UART bridge to Core-2 (ESP32).
- **Dynamixel Bus**: Controls up to 7 servos.
- **Onboard LED**: Used for status indication (blinking).

---

## **External Libraries & Dependencies**

- **Arduino.h**: Core Arduino functions.

- **Servos**: Dynamixel, using protocol 2.0, baud 57600.
- **Core-2 Link**: Serial3 at 115200 baud, pins D14 (TX) and D13 (RX).
- **Power Enable Pin**: `BDPIN_DXL_PWR_EN` (board-defined macro).
- **Number of Servos**: 7, with IDs 0–6.
- **Manual/Auto Calibration**: Some servos use manual limits, others are auto-calibrated.

---

## **Code Structure & Component Interaction**

### **1. Preprocessor & Compatibility Layer**
- **Printf Compatibility**: Ensures debug output works on all cores, even if `Serial.printf()` isn’t available (not on SAMD).
- **Serial Aliases**: `Serial2` is aliased to `Serial3` for compatibility with code expecting `Serial2`.

### **2. Servo Configuration**
- **Servo IDs and Names**: Arrays define which servos are present and their names.
- **Manual Limits**: Some servos use predefined min/max angles; others are auto-calibrated.

### **3. Helper Functions**
- **Angle/Tick Conversion**: Converts between degrees and Dynamixel ticks.
- **findLimit**: Moves a servo in steps until it stalls (mechanical limit).
- **printAllServoStatus**: Prints current, min, and max positions for all servos.
- **calibrateOrAssignLimits**: For each servo, either assigns manual limits or auto-calibrates by finding mechanical stops.
- **sendLimitsToCore2**: Sends calibration and ping results to Core-2 as a CSV string.
- **handleMoveServoCommand**: Parses and executes servo move commands from Core-2.
- **blinkOnboardLED**: Blinks the onboard LED for status indication.

### **4. Setup Routine**
- **Serial Initialization**: Starts debug, Dynamixel, and Core-2 serial ports.
- **Dynamixel Power Enable**: Turns on servo power.
- **Handshake with Core-2**: Waits up to 10 seconds for a "HELLO"/"ESP32" handshake. If not received, enters "dry run" mode (no servo action).
- **Servo Probing & Calibration**:
  - Pings each servo.
  - If found, calibrates or assigns limits.
  - Stores results for later reporting.
- **Status Reporting**: Prints and sends calibration results to Core-2.

### **5. Main Loop**
- **Command Handling**: Listens for "MOVE_SERVO" commands from Core-2 and executes them if not in dry run.
- **Demo Sweep**: Sweeps the first servo back and forth twice, then turns on its LED as a demo.

## **Key Classes, Functions, and Responsibilities**

- **Dynamixel2Arduino dxl**: Main object for communicating with Dynamixel servos.
- **findLimit(id, dir)**: Finds the mechanical limit of a servo by moving it stepwise until it stalls.
- **calibrateOrAssignLimits(idx)**: Calibrates a servo or assigns manual limits.
- **handleMoveServoCommand(cmd)**: Parses commands like `MOVE_SERVO;ID=1;TARGET=90;VELOCITY=10;` and moves the specified servo.
- **sendLimitsToCore2()**: Sends all servo min/max/ping status to Core-2 as CSV.
- **blinkOnboardLED(times)**: Blinks the onboard LED for visual feedback.

---

## **Notable Algorithms & Logic**

- **Automatic Limit Finding**: For servos without manual limits, the code moves the servo in steps (15°) until it detects a stall (movement less than 20% of the step), indicating a mechanical stop.
- **Handshake Protocol**: Waits for a specific response from Core-2 before enabling servo actions, ensuring both sides are ready.
- **Dry Run Mode**: If handshake fails, disables all servo actions for safety.
- **Command Parsing**: Extracts servo ID, target angle, and velocity from incoming UART commands using string manipulation.
