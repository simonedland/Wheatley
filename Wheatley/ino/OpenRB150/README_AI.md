# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatley\ino\OpenRB150\default.ino
Certainly! Here’s a detailed summary of the provided Arduino sketch in plain English:

---

## **Overall Purpose**

This Arduino sketch acts as a **bidirectional serial bridge** (or "pass-through") between a computer (via USB Serial) and a DYNAMIXEL bus (via a hardware serial port, typically `Serial1`). It allows data to be sent and received between the two interfaces, making it useful for debugging, configuring, or communicating with DYNAMIXEL servo motors using a PC and an Arduino-compatible board.

---

## **Main Functions & Responsibilities**

### 1. **setup()**
- **Initializes hardware and communication:**
  - Sets the built-in LED pin as an output.
  - Starts the USB serial port (`Serial`) at 57600 baud for communication with the PC.
  - Initializes the DYNAMIXEL bus serial port (`Serial1`) to match the USB baud rate (57600).
  - Prepares the DYNAMIXEL2Arduino library for communication.

### 2. **loop()**
- **Main execution loop:**
  - Continuously calls `dataTransceiver()` to handle data transfer between USB and DYNAMIXEL bus.
  - Checks if the USB baud rate has changed; if so, updates the DYNAMIXEL bus baud rate to match.

### 3. **dataTransceiver()**
- **Handles data transfer in both directions:**
  - **USB → DXL:** Reads all available bytes from the USB serial port and writes them to the DYNAMIXEL bus.
  - **DXL → USB:** Reads all available bytes from the DYNAMIXEL bus (up to a buffer limit) and writes them to the USB serial port.
  - Calls `ledStatus()` to indicate activity.

### 4. **ledStatus()**
- **Visual activity indicator:**
  - Turns the built-in LED on for 200 ms after data transfer, then turns it off, providing a visual cue when data is being relayed.

---

## **Hardware Peripherals Used**

- **USB Serial Port (`Serial`):** For communication with a PC.
- **DYNAMIXEL Bus Serial Port (`Serial1`):** For communication with DYNAMIXEL servos.
- **Built-in LED (`LED_BUILTIN`):** For activity indication.

---

## **Key Classes, Functions, and Their Responsibilities**

- **`Dynamixel2Arduino` class (from the Dynamixel2Arduino library):**
  - Handles low-level communication with DYNAMIXEL devices.
  - `dxl.begin(baudrate)`: Initializes the DYNAMIXEL bus at the specified baud rate.
  - `dxl.getPortBaud()`: Returns the current baud rate of the DYNAMIXEL bus.

- **`dataTransceiver()` function:**
  - Transfers data between USB and DYNAMIXEL bus in both directions.
  - Uses a buffer to prevent overflow when reading from DYNAMIXEL bus.

- **`ledStatus()` function:**
  - Manages LED state to indicate recent data activity.

---

## **Structure & Component Interaction**

- **Initialization:** `setup()` configures the serial ports and LED.
- **Main Loop:** `loop()` repeatedly calls `dataTransceiver()` to check for and relay data in both directions.
- **Baud Rate Sync:** If the USB baud rate changes, the DYNAMIXEL bus is reconfigured to match.
- **Data Transfer:** Data is read from one interface and written to the other, with a buffer to prevent overflow.
- **LED Feedback:** The built-in LED is toggled to show when data is being relayed.

---

## **Notable Algorithms or Logic**

- **Serial Pass-Through:** The core logic is a simple, efficient serial pass-through, relaying bytes as they arrive.
- **Buffer Management:** Uses a fixed-size buffer (`packet_buffer`) to prevent overruns when reading from the DYNAMIXEL bus.
- **LED Timing:** Uses `millis()` to ensure the LED is only on briefly after data transfer, avoiding blocking delays.

---

## **External Libraries & Dependencies**

- **Dynamixel2Arduino**: Required for DYNAMIXEL communication. Must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager or from [ROBOTIS GitHub](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/Dynamixel2Arduino).

---

## **Configuration & Environment Requirements**

- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino-compatible board with at least two serial ports (e.g., Arduino Mega, Leonardo, or boards with a DYNAMIXEL Shield).
  - DYNAMIXEL servos connected to the appropriate serial port (usually `Serial1`).
  - PC connected via USB.

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE.
  - Dynamixel2Arduino library installed.
  - Serial monitor or terminal program on the PC set to 57600 baud (default).

- **Baud Rate:** Both USB and DYNAMIXEL bus must use the same baud rate for proper operation.

Certainly! Here’s a detailed summary of the provided Arduino sketch, written in plain English, covering its purpose, structure, hardware use, main logic, and notable implementation details.

---

## **Overall Purpose**

This Arduino sketch is designed for the **OpenRB-150** board and demonstrates a **UART bridge** between the OpenRB-150 and a "Core-2" device (likely an ESP32-based controller), while also performing **multi-servo calibration** for Dynamixel servos. It supports both **automatic and manual calibration** of servo limits, communicates results to the Core-2, and allows the Core-2 to command servo movements. There is also a demo sweep of the first servo and visual feedback via the onboard LED.

- **Dynamixel Servos**: Up to 7, connected via Serial1.
- **Onboard LED**: Used for status indication (blinking on handshake).

---

## **External Libraries & Dependencies**

- **Arduino.h**: Core Arduino functions.
- **Dynamixel2Arduino**: For controlling Dynamixel servos.

## **Key Classes, Functions, and Responsibilities**

### **Global Constants and Macros**

- **Serial Aliases**: `DEBUG_SERIAL` for debug, `LINK_SERIAL` (Serial3) for Core-2.
- **Calibration Settings**: Step size, wait times, thresholds, etc.
- **Servo Table**: IDs, names, manual/auto calibration flags, manual limits.

### **Helper Functions**

- **deg2t / t2deg**: Convert between degrees and Dynamixel ticks.
- **findLimit**: Moves a servo incrementally in one direction until it stalls (mechanical limit), used for auto-calibration.
- **printAllServoStatus**: Prints min, max, and current position for each servo.
- **calibrateOrAssignLimits**: For each servo, either assigns manual limits or runs auto-calibration using `findLimit`.
- **sendLimitsToCore2**: Sends calibration results and ping status to Core-2 as a CSV string.
- **handleMoveServoCommand**: Parses and executes a "MOVE_SERVO" command from Core-2, setting target position and velocity.
- **blinkOnboardLED**: Blinks the onboard LED a specified number of times for visual feedback.

### **Main Structure**

#### **setup()**

1. **Initialize Serial Ports**: Debug, Dynamixel bus, and Core-2 link.
2. **Enable Dynamixel Power**.
3. **Handshake with Core-2**:
   - Sends "HELLO" repeatedly for up to 10 seconds.
   - Waits for a response containing "ESP32".
   - If successful, disables `dryRun` and blinks the onboard LED.
   - If not, sets `dryRun` to true (no servo actions/calibration).
4. **Servo Detection & Calibration** (if not dryRun):
   - Pings each servo.
   - If found, calibrates (auto/manual) and enables torque.
   - If not found, sets limits to zero.
5. **Prints Servo Status** and **sends calibration results to Core-2**.

#### **loop()**

1. **Command Handling**:
   - If not in dryRun and data is available from Core-2, reads a line.
   - If the message starts with "MOVE_SERVO", parses and executes the command.
2. **Demo Sweep**:
   - Sweeps the first servo (back and forth) twice between its min/max limits.
   - After two cycles, turns on the servo's LED and prints "[DONE]".
   - Ensures servo torque is on during the sweep.
