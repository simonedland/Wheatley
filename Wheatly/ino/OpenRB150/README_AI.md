## **Overall Purpose**

This Arduino sketch acts as a **bidirectional serial bridge** between a computer (via USB) and a DYNAMIXEL servo bus (via a UART port, typically Serial1). It allows data to be passed back and forth between the USB serial port and the DYNAMIXEL bus, making it useful for debugging, firmware updates, or controlling DYNAMIXEL servos from a PC.

## **Main Functions and Responsibilities**

### 1. **setup()**
- **Purpose:** Initializes hardware and communication settings.
- **Actions:**
  - Sets the built-in LED as an output.

  - Calls `ledStatus()` whenever data is sent in either direction to indicate activity.

### 4. **ledStatus()**
- **Purpose:** Provides a visual indicator (using the built-in LED) when data is being transferred.
- **Actions:**
  - Turns the LED on for 200ms after data transfer, then turns it off.

## **Structure of the Code**

1. **Global Definitions and Initialization:**
   - Defines serial ports, buffer size, and creates necessary objects.
2. **setup():**
   - Initializes hardware and communication.
3. **loop():**
   - Continuously calls the data transfer function and checks for baud rate changes.
4. **dataTransceiver():**
   - Handles all data movement between USB and DYNAMIXEL bus.
5. **ledStatus():**
   - Manages the activity LED.

---

## **Component Interaction**

- **PC ↔ USB Serial ↔ Arduino ↔ UART (Serial1) ↔ DYNAMIXEL Bus**
- Data from the PC is read from the USB serial port and written to the DYNAMIXEL bus, and vice versa.
- The built-in LED is toggled to indicate when data is being transferred.

---

## **Notable Algorithms or Logic**

- **Serial Bridging:** The main logic is a simple, robust serial bridge, forwarding bytes between two serial interfaces.
- **LED Activity Indicator:** Uses a timestamp (`led_update_time`) and `millis()` to ensure the LED is only briefly lit after data transfer, providing a clear activity signal without flicker.

---

## **External Libraries and Dependencies**

- **Dynamixel2Arduino:**  
  - Required for communication with DYNAMIXEL servos.
  - Must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager or manually.
- **Hardware:**  
  - Arduino board with at least two serial ports (e.g., Arduino Mega, Leonardo, or boards with a DYNAMIXEL Shield).
  - DYNAMIXEL servos and appropriate wiring.

---

## **Configuration and Environment Requirements**

- **Baud Rate:** Both USB and DYNAMIXEL bus must be set to the same baud rate (default: 57600).
- **Protocol Version:** The DYNAMIXEL protocol version should match between the library and the servos (though the code does not explicitly set it here).
- **Buffer Size:** The buffer is set to 1024 bytes; if larger packets are expected, this may need adjustment.
- **Board Compatibility:** The code assumes the presence of Serial1 and a built-in LED.

Certainly! Here’s a detailed summary of the provided Arduino sketch, written in plain English:

---

## **Overall Purpose**

This Arduino sketch is designed for an **OpenRB-150** board (or similar) to act as a **UART bridge and servo calibration demo**. It connects to a "Core-2" device (likely an ESP32-based controller) via UART (Serial3), manages a bus of Dynamixel servos, and can calibrate their mechanical limits. It also allows the Core-2 to command servo movements and receive calibration data.

---

## **Main Functions and Responsibilities**

### **1. UART Bridge & Handshake**
- **Purpose:** Establishes a reliable UART (serial) communication link between the OpenRB-150 and a Core-2 device.
- **How:** Uses Serial3 (pins D14/D13) for communication. On startup, it performs a 10-second handshake, sending "HELLO" and waiting for a response containing "ESP32". If handshake fails, the system enters "dry run" mode (no servo actions).

### **2. Dynamixel Servo Bus Management**
- **Purpose:** Controls up to 7 Dynamixel servos via Serial1.
- **How:** Uses the [Dynamixel2Arduino](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/arduino_api/overview/) library for communication and control.

### **3. Servo Calibration**
- **Purpose:** Determines the mechanical limits (min/max positions) of each servo, either automatically or via manual configuration.
- **How:** For each servo, either:
  - **Manual:** Uses predefined min/max angles.
  - **Automatic:** Steps the servo in each direction until it stalls (doesn’t move as expected), recording the last good position.

### **4. Command Handling**
- **Purpose:** Receives and executes servo movement commands from Core-2.
- **How:** Listens for commands like `MOVE_SERVO;ID=...;TARGET=...;VELOCITY=...;` via Serial3, parses them, and moves the specified servo.

### **5. Status Reporting**
- **Purpose:** Reports calibration results and servo presence to Core-2.
- **How:** Sends a CSV-formatted string with each servo's ID, min/max angle, and ping status.

### **6. Demo Routine**
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates servo movement by sweeping the first servo back and forth twice, then turning on its LED.

---

## **Hardware Peripherals Used**

- **Serial Ports:**
  - `Serial` (USB): Debug output.
  - `Serial1`: Dynamixel servo bus.
  - `Serial3` (aliased as `Serial2`): UART link to Core-2.
- **Digital Output:**
  - `DXL_PWR_EN`: Enables power to the Dynamixel bus.
  - `LED_BUILTIN`: Onboard LED for status indication.

---

## **Key Classes, Functions, and Their Responsibilities**

### **Classes/Objects**
- **Dynamixel2Arduino dxl:** Handles all communication and control for Dynamixel servos.

### **Functions**
- **deg2t / t2deg:** Convert between degrees and Dynamixel ticks.
- **findLimit:** Moves a servo stepwise in a direction until it stalls, returning the last good position.
- **printAllServoStatus:** Prints a table of all servos’ min/max/current positions to the debug serial.
- **calibrateOrAssignLimits:** For a given servo, either assigns manual limits or auto-calibrates using `findLimit`.
- **sendLimitsToCore2:** Sends calibration and ping results to Core-2 in CSV format.
- **handleMoveServoCommand:** Parses and executes a servo movement command from Core-2.
- **blinkOnboardLED:** Blinks the onboard LED a specified number of times.

---

## **Code Structure and Component Interaction**

### **Setup**
1. **Initialize Serial Ports** for debug, Dynamixel, and Core-2 link.
2. **Enable Dynamixel Power** and set up bus.
3. **Perform Handshake** with Core-2. If handshake fails, enter dry-run mode (no servo actions).
4. **Probe and Calibrate Servos:** For each servo, ping it, and if present, calibrate limits (auto/manual).
5. **Send Calibration Results** to Core-2.

### **Loop**
1. **Command Handling:** If not in dry-run and a command is received from Core-2, parse and execute it.
2. **Demo Sweep:** Sweeps the first servo back and forth twice, then turns on its LED.

---

## **Notable Algorithms and Logic**

- **Auto-Calibration:** Steps the servo in a direction, checking if it moves as expected. If not, assumes a mechanical limit is reached.
- **Handshake Logic:** Repeatedly sends "HELLO" and waits for "ESP32" response for up to 10 seconds.
- **Dry-Run Mode:** If handshake fails, disables all servo actions for safety.
- **Command Parsing:** Extracts parameters from a semi-colon delimited string.
