# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatly\python\src\hardware\arduino_interface.py
The Python code defines an interface for communicating with Arduino hardware, specifically focusing on controlling servos to perform animations based on emotions. The main components include:

1. **ArduinoInterface Class**: Manages the connection to the Arduino via a specified port and baud rate. It can send commands to the Arduino and handle responses. A dry-run mode is available for testing without actual hardware.

2. **Servo Class**: Represents a servo motor with attributes like ID, angle, velocity, and range. It includes a method to move the servo to a target angle within its defined range.

3. **ServoController Class**: Manages multiple servos, each configured with specific parameters like name, angle range, and animation interval. It defines a variety of emotional animations, each with specific servo configurations (velocities, target factors, idle ranges, and intervals).

4. **Emotion Animations**: The `ServoController` class includes predefined animations for different emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad), which adjust the servos' movements to reflect these emotions.

5. **Set Animation Method**: The `ArduinoInterface` class can set animations on the Arduino hardware by sending commands that adjust the servos according to the selected emotion's parameters.

Overall, the code provides a structured way to control servos connected to an Arduino, allowing for expressive animations based on emotional states.
