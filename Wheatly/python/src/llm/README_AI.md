# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatly\python\src\llm\google_agent.py
The Python code defines a system for managing Google Calendar events using a combination of Google APIs and OpenAI's language model. It consists of two main classes: `GoogleCalendarManager` and `GoogleAgent`.

1. **GoogleCalendarManager**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages interactions with Google Calendar.
   - **Logic**:
     - Loads configuration from a YAML file.
     - Authenticates and builds a Google Calendar service using OAuth2 credentials.
     - Lists calendars, excluding those specified in the configuration.
     - Retrieves upcoming events from calendars within a specified number of days.

2. **GoogleAgent**:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as an interface between user requests and Google Calendar operations, utilizing OpenAI's language model to decide which actions to perform.
   - **Logic**:
     - Loads configuration and initializes the OpenAI API with a key.
     - Contains a list of placeholder functions for interacting with Google Calendar (e.g., getting events, creating, and deleting events).
     - Uses a language model to decide which Google tool to use based on user requests.
     - Dispatches the chosen function to perform the desired calendar operation.

Overall, the system is designed to automate calendar management tasks by interpreting user requests and executing the appropriate actions on Google Calendar.

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatly\python\src\llm\llm_client.py
This Python code is designed to interact with various APIs to perform tasks such as text-to-speech conversion, weather retrieval, joke and quote fetching, and more. It uses several libraries and services, including OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and external APIs for weather and jokes.

### Key Components:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The code loads configuration settings from a YAML file, which includes API keys and other parameters.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Utilizes ElevenLabs to convert text to speech. It configures voice settings and generates audio files, which are then played using the `playsound` library.

3. **GPT Client**: Interacts with the OpenAI API to generate text responses based on conversations. It supports functions like setting animations and executing workflows.

4. **Function Execution**: The `Functions` class handles various tasks such as retrieving weather data, jokes, quotes, reversing text, and getting city coordinates. It uses external APIs to fetch data and processes it accordingly.

5. **Weather Descriptions**: Provides detailed descriptions for different weather codes, which are used when interpreting weather data.

6. **Google Calendar Integration**: Attempts to import a Google Calendar manager to handle calendar-related tasks, such as printing calendars and upcoming events.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**: Includes basic error handling and logging to manage exceptions and log warnings.

Overall, the code is structured to provide a comprehensive set of utilities for interacting with APIs and performing related tasks, with a focus on text processing and speech synthesis.
