# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatly\python\src\tts\tts_engine.py
The Python code defines a `TextToSpeechEngine` class that uses the ElevenLabs API to convert text to speech and play the resulting audio. The class is initialized with configurations loaded from a YAML file, including API keys and text-to-speech parameters like voice settings and model ID. 

The main method, `generate_and_play_advanced`, generates audio from the given text, saves it temporarily in a "temp" directory, and plays it using the `playsound` library. After playback, the temporary audio file is deleted. The code also handles exceptions during audio playback and file deletion, logging any errors encountered. 

The script is designed to be run as a standalone program, where it initializes the text-to-speech engine and processes a sample text.
