# AI Summary

### C:\GIT\Wheatly\Wheatley\Wheatley\tts\tts_engine.py
Certainly! Here is a detailed summary and analysis of the provided Python script:

---

## **Overall Purpose**

The script provides a simple, reusable Python wrapper around the [ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech (TTS) API](https://elevenlabs.io/), allowing text to be converted to speech and played back through the systemâ€™s audio output. The main class, `TextToSpeechEngine`, handles configuration, API communication, audio stream management, and playback. It is designed for integration into larger projects, with configuration managed via a YAML file.

---

## **Main Class: `TextToSpeechEngine`**

### **Responsibilities**

- **Configuration Management:** Loads TTS and API settings from a YAML config file.
- **API Communication:** Uses the ElevenLabs API to generate speech audio from text.
- **Audio Playback:** Manages a persistent audio output stream for low-latency playback.
- **Resource Management:** Keeps the audio device alive and ensures resources are cleaned up.
- **Minimal Interface:** Exposes simple methods for generating and playing speech.

---

## **Structure and Component Interactions**

### **1. Configuration Loading**

- **Method:** `_load_config`
- **Function:** Reads `config/config.yaml` to obtain:
  - ElevenLabs API key (from a `secrets` section)
  - Voice ID, model ID, and various voice settings (from a `tts` section)
  - Output format for audio
- **Usage:** Called during initialization and can be reloaded at runtime via `reload_config`.

### **2. Initialization and Audio Stream Setup**

- **Constructor:** `__init__`
- **Functionality:**
  - Loads configuration.
  - Initializes the ElevenLabs API client.
  - Sets up a persistent PyAudio output stream (mono, 22,050 Hz, 16-bit).
  - Starts a background thread to keep the audio device alive by playing near-silent tones when not actively playing speech.

### **3. Speech Generation and Playback**

- **Method:** `elevenlabs_generate_audio_stream`
  - Calls the ElevenLabs API to generate an audio stream for a given text, yielding MP3-encoded audio chunks.
- **Method:** `generate_and_play_advanced`
  - Reloads config, starts timing, and requests an audio stream from the API.
  - Buffers incoming MP3 chunks, decodes them to PCM using `pydub`, and writes them to the persistent audio stream for immediate playback.
  - Uses initial and subsequent buffer thresholds to balance latency and smooth playback.
  - Records timing for both generation and playback phases (via `record_timing`).
- **Method:** `play_mp3_bytes`
  - Plays arbitrary MP3 audio data through the persistent stream (decoding via `pydub`).

### **4. Audio Device Keep-Alive**

- **Method:** `_keep_audio_device_alive`
  - Runs in a background thread.
  - Periodically writes a very quiet 60 Hz sine wave to the audio stream when not actively playing speech, preventing the audio device from powering down or introducing latency.

### **5. Resource Cleanup**

- **Method:** `close`
  - Stops the keep-alive thread, closes the audio stream, and terminates the PyAudio instance.
- **Destructor:** `__del__`
  - Ensures cleanup on object deletion.

---

## **External Dependencies**

- **PyYAML (`yaml`):** For reading configuration files.
- **PyAudio (`pyaudio`):** For low-level audio playback.
- **pydub:** For decoding MP3 audio and manipulating audio data.
- **elevenlabs:** Official ElevenLabs API client.
- **utils.timing_logger:** Custom module for recording timing metrics (not standard; assumed to be project-specific).
- **threading:** For background keep-alive thread.
- **io, os, time, logging:** Standard library modules.

---

## **Configuration Requirements**

- **File:** `config/config.yaml` (expected to be two directories up from the script location)
  - **`secrets.elevenlabs_api_key`:** Required for API access.
  - **`tts.voice_id`, `tts.model_id`, `tts.stability`, etc.:** Optional, with defaults provided.
- **Directory Structure:** The script expects a specific directory layout for configuration.

---

## **Notable Algorithms and Logic**

### **1. Persistent Audio Stream and Keep-Alive**

- The engine keeps the audio output stream open at all times, reducing latency for speech playback.
- A background thread writes near-silent audio when idle, preventing the audio device from sleeping or introducing pops/clicks when starting playback.

### **2. Buffered Streaming Playback**

- Audio is streamed from the ElevenLabs API in MP3 chunks.
- Chunks are buffered and periodically decoded to PCM for playback, balancing between low latency (quick start) and smooth playback (avoiding underruns).
- The buffering logic uses a larger initial buffer, then smaller chunks, to ensure playback starts quickly but remains smooth.

### **3. Timing Metrics**

- The engine records timing for both the TTS generation and playback phases, likely for performance monitoring or debugging.

---

## **How Components Interact**

- **Initialization:** Loads config, sets up API client and audio stream, starts keep-alive thread.
- **Speech Request:** On `generate_and_play_advanced`, config is reloaded, speech is requested from API, and audio is played as it streams in.
- **Playback:** Audio is decoded and written to the persistent stream; the keep-alive thread is paused during active playback.
- **Cleanup:** On close or object deletion, all resources are released.

---

## **Entry Point**

- When run as a script, it instantiates the engine and performs a test TTS playback with the phrase "Hello, world! This is a test."
